    <h2 id="about">About</h2>

    <img src="https://neat.joeldare.com/images/neat-screenshot.png" class="bordered">
    
    <p>Neat is a simple HTML template. It's tiny, opinionated, and made to last. It's created by Joel Dare and heavily inspired by other minimalist sites like <a href="https://100r.co">Hundred Rabbits</a> and dozens of similar blogs.</p>

    <p>Neat is about 1KiB and that is not minified or compressed. This documentation adds another 7KiB. That compresses to about 5KiB in a downloadable zip file.</p>

    <p>"That's pretty neat!"</p>


    <h2 id="start">Getting Started</h2>

    <p>Grab the <em>neat.css</em> and <em>neat.html</em> files.</p>

    <pre><code>curl -O https://neat.joeldare.com/neat.css
curl -O https://neat.joeldare.com/neat.html</code></pre>

    <p>Then copy <em>neat.html</em> to <em>index.html</em> and make your changes. Use <em>neat.html</em> as a reference.</p>

    <h2 id="uses">Uses</h2>

    <p><em>Neat</em> was designed for.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Blogs</li>
        <li>Journals</li>
        <li>Technical sites</li>
        <li>Documentation</li>
        <li>Books</li>
        <li>Simple shops</li>
    </ul>


    <h2 id="customizing">Customizing</h2>

    <p>It's easy to customize Neat. The best way is to create a new <em>custom.css</em> file and then add the following line to the head of your page.</p>

    <pre>&lt;link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="custom.css"&gt;</pre>
        
    <p>That will give you the option of updating <em>neat.css</em> without losing any of your personalizations.</p>


    <h2 id="decisions">Design Decisions</h2>

    <p>Neat is opinionated and here are some of the design decisions and the rationale for each of them.</p>

    <h3>Small</h3>

    <p>In contrast with the majority of the modern web, Neat was designed to be tiny. A side-effect of being small is that it's also very fast.</p>

    <h3>Low Energy</h3>

    <p>Because it's small and fast it also consumes fewer resources. It should work well even on the slowest connections. Consuming less energy on both the client and the server.</p>

    <h3>Long-Lasting</h3>

    <p>The web is relatively young and technology changes fast but one of the technologies that has lasted as long as the Internet is HTML. There are lots of other interesting formats but plain HTML has a good chance of working well into the future.</p>

    <h3>Not Minified</h3>

    <p>Minified code requires the complexity of a transpiler and makes the site less open for inspection, learning, accessibility, and archive. The size trade-off isn't worth it for Neat.</p>

    <h3>Max Width</h3>

    <p>The body <em>max-width</em> is 800px by default. <a href="https://cdn.tc-library.org/Edlab/eye-tracking%20article.pdf">Research</a> has shown that limiting the width can lead to better retention of the content itself, as well as a decrease in eye strain. A thinner column of text is more readable on very large monitors. This is simple to change by editing the <em>max-width</em> of the <em>body</em> element in your <em>custom.css</em> file.</p>

    <h3>Images</h3>

    <p>Images are 100% width by default. This works best with images that are wide and short. You can set manual sizes on individual images as it suits you or change the image width in your <em>custom.css</em> if you typically use a different aspect ratio.</p>

    <p>Images have no border by default. This works well for dark colored images but light colored images can get lost. Add something like <code>border: 3px solid #404040</code> if your image needs a border.</p>

    <h3>Left Gutter</h3>

    <p>The left gutter is wider at larger sizes, giving the page a little more breathing room at desktop and tablet sizes.</p> 

    <h3>Button are Often Links</h3>

    <p>It's best to use semantic web tags whenever possible. Buttons are a unique case where you're often linking somewhere, but the button tag doesn't currently support the href attribute. So, buttons can be <em>anchor</em> tags with a <em>class</em> of <em>button</em>. You can also throw a <em>div</em>, with a <em>center</em> class, around them if you want a button centered.</p>

    <pre>&lt;a class="button" href="#"&gt;Button&lt;/a&gt;</pre>

    <div class="center">
        <a href="#" class="button">Button</a>
    </div>

    <h3>Buttons</h3>

    <p>The <em>button</em> tag is also styled in the same way. When buttons aren't links, for example when you're using JavaScript to trigger actions from button clicks, the button tag still works.</p>

    <pre>&lt;button&gt;Button&lt;/button&gt;</pre>

    <button class="center">Button</button>

    <h3>Input</h3>

    <p>The <em>input</em> tag is styled to support light and dark themes.</p>

    <pre>&lt;input&gt;</pre>

    <input class="center" value="My input here">

    <h3>No Header</h3>

    <p>Because of the complexity of the css and the distraction of navigation, there is no header and no navigation, other than the link back to the home page.</p>

    <h3>Responsive</h3>

    <p>Neat is designed to be responsive.</p>
